 *  CFNetServiceResolve()   *** DEPRECATED ***
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *	Resolves the addressing for the given service.  This requires
 *	that the service has a domain, a type, and a name.  The service
 *	is  resolved on the network until this function returns or is
 *	cancelled by calling CFNetServiceCancel. In synchronous mode,
 *	this function will block until there is an error or it is
 *	cancelled from another thread.  In asynchronous mode, this
 *	function returns immediately and the underlying network
 *	resolution process will start. 
 *	
 *	As a result of new, better performing API's in Service Discovery,
 *	users should now call CFNetServiceResolveWithTimeout.  If needing
 *	to monitor TXT record changes, users should use the new
 *	CFNetServiceMonitor object. Using the new calls will allow your

 *  Summary:
 *    Allocate a relocatable memory block of a specified size.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The NewHandle function attempts to allocate a new relocatable
 *    block in the current heap zone with a logical size of logicalSize
 *    bytes and then return a handle to the block. The new block is
 *    unlocked and unpurgeable. If NewHandle cannot allocate a block of

 *    WARNING
 *    
 *    Do not try to manufacture your own handles without this function
 *    by simply assigning the address of a variable of type Ptr to a
 *    variable of type Handle. The resulting "fake handle" would not
 *    reference a relocatable block and could cause a system crash.

 *    The HPurge procedure makes the relocatable block to which h is a

 *    nothing.
 *    
 *    On Mac OS X, heaps are never purged.  Therefore, the use of

 *    program will essentially be removed.
 *    
 *    However, some applications may set the handle as purgeable, and
 *    then later check the purgeBit for the handle via HGetState().  If
 *    your application depends on the purge bit being set for handles,

 *    DisposePtr function to free it for other uses.
 *    Call the function MemError to get the result code. See "Memory

 *    After a call to DisposePtr, all pointers to the released block
 *    become invalid and should not be used again. Any subsequent use
 *    of a pointer to the released block might cause a system error. 
 *    You can pass the value NULL as the pointer to dispose.

{

 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Releases memory occupied by a relocatable block.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The DisposeHandle function releases the memory occupied by the
 *    relocatable block whose handle is h. It also frees the handleÕs
 *    master pointer for other uses.
 *    Do not use DisposeHandle to dispose of a handle obtained from the
 *    Resource Manager (for example, by a previous call to
 *    GetResource), useReleaseResource instead. If, however, you have
 *    called DetachResource on a resource handle, you should dispose of
 *    the storage by callingDisposeHandle.
 *    Call the function MemError to get the result code. See "Memory
 *    Manager Result Codes".
 *    After a call to DisposeHandle, all handles to the released block
 *    become invalid and should not be used again. Any subsequent calls
 *    to DisposeHandleusing an invalid handle might damage the master
 *    pointer list.  You can pass the value NULL as the handle to
 *    dispose.

{
 *  SetHandleSize()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Changes the logical size of the relocatable block corresponding
 *    to the specified handle.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Change the logical size of the relocatable block corresponding to
 *    the specified handle. SetHandleSize might need to move the
 *    relocatable block to obtain enough space for the resized block.
 *    Thus, for best results you should unlock a block before resizing
 *    it.
 *    
 *    An attempt to increase the size of a locked block might fail,
 *    because of blocks above and below it that are either
 *    nonrelocatable or locked. You should be prepared for this
 *    possibility.
 *    
 *    Instead of using the SetHandleSize function to set the size of a
 *    handle to 0, you can use the EmptyHandle function.
 *  
 *  Mac OS X threading:
 *    Thread safe since version 10.3
 *  
 *  Parameters:

 *      a handle to a relocatable block.

<<<<<<< HEAD
 *  Summary:
 *    Purges a relocatable block and sets the corresponding handleÕs

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The EmptyHandle function purges the relocatable block whose
 *    handle is h and sets the handleÕs master pointer to NULL. The
 *    EmptyHandle function allows you to free memory taken by a
 *    relocatable block without freeing the relocatable blockÕs master
 *    pointer for other uses. The block whose handle is h must be
 *    unlocked but need not be purgeable.
 *    
 *    Note that if there are multiple handles to the relocatable block,
 *    then calling the EmptyHandle function empties them all, because
 *    all of the handles share a common master pointer. When you later
 *    use ReallocateHandle to reallocate space for the block, the
 *    master pointer is updated, and all of the handles reference the
 *    new block correctly.
 *    
 *    To free the memory taken up by a relocatable block and release
 *    the blockÕs master pointer for other uses, use the DisposeHandle
 *    function.

{
 *  HGetState()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Get the current state of the handle's locked, purgeable, and R
 *    bits
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The HGetState function returns a signed byte (char) containing
 *    the flags of the master pointer for the given handle. You can
 *    save this byte, change the state of any of the flags using the
 *    functions described in this section, and then restore their
 *    original states by passing the byte to the HSetState
 *    function.
 *    
 *    You can use bit-manipulation functions on the returned signed
 *    byte to determine the value of a given attribute.
 *    Currently the following bits are used:
 *    kHandleIsResourceBit    - if set, handle is a resource
 *     kHandlePurgeableBit - if set, handle is purgeable
 *     kHandleLockedBit - if set, handle is locked
 *    On Mac OS X and later, heaps are never purged, so the purgeable
 *    bit is used but its setting is essentially ignored. Also, since
 *    heaps are never compacted, and therefore the only time a handle
 *    moves is when that handle is resized, the danger of using
 *    defererenced handles is lower and so handles likely do not need
 *    to be locked as often. Because of this, the state for a handle is
 *    less useful, and HGetState() and other functions is being
 *    deprecated.  If you define a macro named
 *    __MAC_OS_X_MEMORY_MANAGER_CLEAN__ in your sources before you
 *    include MacMemory.h, then HGetState() and several other functions
 *    will become empty operations, removing the overhead of a function
 *    call.
 *    
 *    However, some applications may depend on the state bits of a
 *    handle being correct or changing as functions like HLock(), etc.,
 *    are called.  Applications which rely on this can not use
 *    __MAC_OS_X_MEMORY_MANAGER_CLEAN__.

    Beginning in Mac OS X Tiger, BlockMove, BlockMoveData, BlockMoveUncached,
    BlockMoveDataUncached, BlockZero, and BlockZeroUncached are inlined to a
    direct call to the posix memmove or bzero functions; this allows the 
    compiler to optimize in some cases.
    
    However, CarbonCore.framework still exports functions with these names,
    both so old code which linked them there will run and to support
    compilers which don't support inline function definitions.

    To use the exported version of BlockMove, #define NO_BLOCKMOVE_INLINE
    in your source code ( or prefix header file ) before including any headers
    which would include MacMemory.h.

 *  Summary:
 *    Allocates a nonrelocatable block of memory of a specified size
 *    with all its bytes set to 0.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The NewPtr function attempts to reserve space for the new block.
 *    If it is able to reserve the requested amount of space, NewPtr
 *    allocates the nonrelocatable block.  Otherwise, NewPtr returns
 *    NULL and generates a memFullErr error. On Mac OS X, NewPtr will
 *    never fail because it is unable to allocate the pointer. Certain
 *    old versions of Mac OS X return a NULL pointer when asked to
 *    allocate a pointer of size 0.
 *    Call the function MemError to get the result code. See "Memory
 *    Manager Result Codes".
 *  
 *  Mac OS X threading:
 *    Thread safe since version 10.3
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    byteCount:
 *      The requested size (in bytes) of the nonrelocatable block.  If
 *      you pass a value of zero, this function returns a valid zero

 *  HLock()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Lock a relocatable block so that it does not move in the heap
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The HLock procedure locks the relocatable block to which h is a
 *    handle, preventing it from being moved within its heap zone. If
 *    the block is already locked,HLock does nothing.
 *    
 *    On Mac OS X, the behaviour of the Memory Manager and of heaps in
 *    general is different than on Mac OS 9.x and earlier. In
 *    particular, the heap on Mac OS X is never purged or compacted. 
 *    Therefore, an unlocked handle will never be relocated except as a
 *    result of a direct action by something calling SetHandleSize() or
 *    by using a function like PtrAndHand() which implicitly resizes
 *    the handle to append data to it.  Because of this, most locking
 *    and unlocking of handles is unnecessary on Mac OS X, and the use
 *    of HLock() and other functions is being deprecated.  If you
 *    define a macro named __MAC_OS_X_MEMORY_MANAGER_CLEAN__ to 1 in
 *    your sources before you include MacMemory.h, then HLock() and
 *    several other functions will become empty operations, removing
 *    the overhead of a function call.
 *    
 *    However, some applications are relying on the behavior that
 *    resizing a locked handle produces an error, or tracking the state
 *    of the locked bit for a give handle via the HGetState() function.
 *     Applications which rely on this can not use
 *    __MAC_OS_X_MEMORY_MANAGER_CLEAN__.

 *  Discussion:

 *    Mac OS before Mac OS X, it would first attempt to move the handle
 *    as high in memory as feasible.  However, on Mac OS X and later,
 *    there is no advantage to having handles high in memory, and so

 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Mark a relocatable block so that it does can be purged if a
 *    memory request cannot be fulfilled after compaction of the heap
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The HPurge procedure makes the relocatable block to which h is a
 *    handle purgeable. If the block is already purgeable, HPurge does
 *    nothing.
 *    
 *    On Mac OS X, heaps are never purged.  Therefore, the use of
 *    HPurge() and its associated functios is deprecated. If you define
 *    a macro __MAC_OS_X_MEMORY_MANAGER_CLEAN__ in your sources before
 *    you include MacMemory.h, then any calls to HPurge() in your
 *    program will essentially be removed.
 *    
 *    However, some applications may set the handle as purgeable, and
 *    then later check the purgeBit for the handle via HGetState().  If
 *    your application depends on the purge bit being set for handles,
 *    you will not be able to take advantage of this macro.

 *      HPurge() just sets MemError() to noErr.

=======
 *  Summary:
 *    Allocate a relocatable memory block of a specified size.
>>>>>>> origin/fixes_2.4
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The TempNewHandle function attempts to allocate a new relocatable
 *    block in the current heap zone with a logical size of logicalSize
 *    bytes and then return a handle to the block. The new block is
 *    unlocked and unpurgeable. If NewHandle cannot allocate a block of
 *    the requested size, it returns NULL.  The memory block returned
 *    likely will contain garbage.
 *    
 *    WARNING
 *    
 *    Do not try to manufacture your own handles without this function
 *    by simply assigning the address of a variable of type Ptr to a
 *    variable of type Handle. The resulting "fake handle" would not
 *    reference a relocatable block and could cause a system crash.
 *     If this function returns NIL, the error result can be determined
 *    by calling the function MemError().
 *    
 *    On Mac OS X, there is no temporary memory heap, and thus no
 *    difference between the handles returned by TempNewHandle() and
 *    those returned by NewHandle().  The only difference between the
 *    two is that TempNewHandle() also returns the error result of the
 *    call in resultCode.

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Change the logical size of the relocatable block corresponding to
 *    the specified handle. SetHandleSize might need to move the
 *    relocatable block to obtain enough space for the resized block.
 *    Thus, for best results you should unlock a block before resizing
 *    it.
 *    
 *    An attempt to increase the size of a locked block might fail,
 *    because of blocks above and below it that are either
 *    nonrelocatable or locked. You should be prepared for this
 *    possibility.
 *    
 *    Instead of using the SetHandleSize function to set the size of a
 *    handle to 0, you can use the EmptyHandle function.

 *    
 *    You can use bit-manipulation functions on the returned signed

 *     kHandlePurgeableBit - if set, handle is purgeable
 *     kHandleLockedBit - if set, handle is locked
 *    On Mac OS X and later, heaps are never purged, so the purgeable
 *    bit is used but its setting is essentially ignored. Also, since

    Beginning in Mac OS X Tiger, BlockMove, BlockMoveData, BlockMoveUncached,
    BlockMoveDataUncached, BlockZero, and BlockZeroUncached are inlined to a
    direct call to the posix memmove or bzero functions; this allows the 
    compiler to optimize in some cases.
    
    However, CarbonCore.framework still exports functions with these names,
    both so old code which linked them there will run and to support
    compilers which don't support inline function definitions.

    To use the exported version of BlockMove, #define NO_BLOCKMOVE_INLINE
    in your source code ( or prefix header file ) before including any headers
    which would include MacMemory.h.

 *  HandToHand()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Copies all of the data from one relocatable block to a new
 *    relocatable block.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The HandToHand function attempts to copy the information in the
 *    relocatable block to which theHndl is a handle; if successful,
 *    HandToHand sets theHndlto a handle pointing to the new
 *    relocatable block.
 *    
 *    If successful in creating a new relocatable block, the HandToHand
 *    function does not duplicate the properties of the original block.
 *    The new block is unlocked, unpurgeable, and not a resource. Call
 *    HLock or HPurge to adjust the properties of the new
 *    block.
 *    
 *    To copy only part of a relocatable block into a new relocatable
 *    block, use the PtrToHand function. Before calling PtrToHand, lock
 *    and dereference the handle pointing to the relocatable block you
 *    want to copy.
 *    
 *    Because HandToHand replaces its parameter with the new handle,
 *    you should retain the original parameter value somewhere else,
 *    otherwise you will not be able to access it.

{
    FSReplaceObject and FSPathReplaceObject

    You can use the FSReplaceObject and FSPathReplaceObject functions to replace
    one object, the original object, with another, the replacement object.
    FSReplaceObject and FSPathReplaceObject are provided to assist in properly
    preserving metadata during safe save operations. These functions allow files
    to replace files, directories to replace directories, directories to replace
    files and files to replace directories (so a package can replace a file, or
    a file can replace a package). Both objects must reside on the same volume.

    If FSReplaceObject or FSPathReplaceObject are successful, the result object
    will exist at the location of the original object. Nothing will exist at the
    location of the replacement object.  By default FSReplaceObject and  FSPathReplaceObject
    will test the object for write access, and fail if write access is not available.
    Write access in this context is ACL_WRITE_DATA for files and ACL_ADD_FILE for directories.
    This check can be bypassed by passing the kFSReplaceObjectDoNotCheckObjectWriteAccess flag.

    FSReplaceObject and FSPathReplaceObject may need to create a temporary object
    when one of the input objects is a directory, or when the
    kFSReplaceObjectSaveOriginalAsABackup option is specified. The temporary object
    is required since the rename system call does not handle non-empty directory
    replacement or file <-> directory replacement. The file replacing file case
    does not use a temporary object (unless the kFSReplaceObjectSaveOriginalAsABackup
    option is specified). If no temporary name is provided and a temporary object
    is required, then the functions will return an error. Providing a temporary
    name will also allow an application to recover the original object should a
    catastrophic failure (such as a power outage) occur during a replacement
    involving a directory. The temporary object will be created with the temporary
    name either in the temporary directory specified by the temporaryDirectory
    parameter, or in the preferred temporary directory (the preferred temporary
    directory can be obtained with the FSGetTemporaryDirectoryForReplaceObject
    or FSPathGetTemporaryDirectoryForReplaceObject functions). 

    If the kFSReplaceObjectSaveOriginalAsABackup option is specified, the original
    object will be saved in one of two locations: If the temporaryName parameter
    is provided, the original object will be saved with that temporary name in
    the temporary directory. If the temporaryName parameter is not provided and
    the newName parameter is provided, the original object will be saved with
    its original name in the temporary directory.

    The result object will have the data (or directory contents) from the
    replacement object, but will have the original object's creation date and
    backup date. By default, the result object will have extended attributes
    merged from the original object and the replacement object, using the extended
    attributes of the replacement object if the original object has extended
    attributes with the same name. If the kFSReplaceObjectReplaceMetadata option
    flag is passed, then the extended attributes of the original object will be
    completely overwritten by the extended attributes of the replacement object.
    
    The kFSReplaceObjectReplaceMetadata also controls how the label, type, creator,
    hidden extension bit, strong binding, custom icon and custom badge are handled.
    For the custom icon, custom badge, label (where a value of 0 is considered not
    present), and strong binding the replacement object's attributes will be
    used if present, otherwise the original object's attributes will be retained.  For
    the extension hidden bit, type, and creator the original object's attribute is
    preserved.  Setting the kFSReplaceObjectReplaceMetadata flag will use the replacement
    object's attributes for all cases.  Type and creator are only handled in the 
    file to file case.  Strong bindings are not applicable to plain directories.
    
    The default handling of ACL and mode info depends on the types of objects
    involved. If the original object and replacement object are of the same type
    (both files or both directories) then the default behavior is to use the ACL
    and mode of the original object. Setting the kFSReplaceObjectReplacePermissionInfo
    flag will use the ACL and mode from the replacementObject.

    If the objects are different types, then the ACL and mode will be based off
    the original object and will translated as follows:

        Mode:
        file r -> dir rx
        file w -> dir wx
        file x -> dir nothing

        dir r -> file r
        dir w -> file w
        dir x -> file nothing

        ACLs:

        ACL_SEARCH will be added to any allow ACE in the file to directory case.
        ACL_EXECUTE will be removed from any ACE in the file to directory case.
        
        ACL_SEARCH and ACL_DELETE_CHILD will be removed from any ACE in the directory to file case.

        File                Directory
        ACL_READ_DATA   <-> ACL_LIST_DIRECTORY
        ACL_WRITE_DATA  <-> ACL_ADD_FILE
        ACL_APPEND_DATA <-> ACL_ADD_SUBDIRECTORY

        ACL_DELETE , ACL_READ_ATTRIBUTES, ACL_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES, ACL_READ_EXTATTRIBUTES,
        ACL_WRITE_EXTATTRIBUTES, ACL_READ_SECURITY, ACL_WRITE_SECURITY and ACL_CHANGE_OWNER
        are the same for both types and will be left alone.
                        
    This translation behavior can be avoided by passing in either
    kFSReplaceObjectPreservePermissionInfo to use the original object ACL and
    mode info unchanged (except where the bits have different meanings for files
    and directories) or kFSReplaceObjectReplacePermissionInfo to use the ACL and
    mode info of the replacement object (except where the bits have different
    meanings for files and directories). Setting both of these flags is an
    error -- the call will fail with a paramErr. The permissions are only set on
    the top-level object -- the permissions inside a directory are unaffected.
    
    FSReplaceObject may not be atomic -- it may issue multiple system calls to
    accurately replace and preserve the metadata of a file system object.
    
    FSReplaceObject may fail if the source or destination files are open or
    the source or destination objects are directories which contain open files.

{
    FSReplaceObject and FSPathReplaceObject

    You can use the FSReplaceObject and FSPathReplaceObject functions to replace
    one object, the original object, with another, the replacement object.
    FSReplaceObject and FSPathReplaceObject are provided to assist in properly
    preserving metadata during safe save operations. These functions allow files
    to replace files, directories to replace directories, directories to replace
    files and files to replace directories (so a package can replace a file, or
    a file can replace a package). Both objects must reside on the same volume.

    If FSReplaceObject or FSPathReplaceObject are successful, the result object
    will exist at the location of the original object. Nothing will exist at the
    location of the replacement object.  By default FSReplaceObject and  FSPathReplaceObject
    will test the object for write access, and fail if write access is not available.
    Write access in this context is ACL_WRITE_DATA for files and ACL_ADD_FILE for directories.
    This check can be bypassed by passing the kFSReplaceObjectDoNotCheckObjectWriteAccess flag.

    FSReplaceObject and FSPathReplaceObject may need to create a temporary object
    when one of the input objects is a directory, or when the
    kFSReplaceObjectSaveOriginalAsABackup option is specified. The temporary object
    is required since the rename system call does not handle non-empty directory
    replacement or file <-> directory replacement. The file replacing file case
    does not use a temporary object (unless the kFSReplaceObjectSaveOriginalAsABackup
    option is specified). If no temporary name is provided and a temporary object
    is required, then the functions will return an error. Providing a temporary
    name will also allow an application to recover the original object should a
    catastrophic failure (such as a power outage) occur during a replacement
    involving a directory. The temporary object will be created with the temporary
    name either in the temporary directory specified by the temporaryDirectory
    parameter, or in the preferred temporary directory (the preferred temporary
    directory can be obtained with the FSGetTemporaryDirectoryForReplaceObject
    or FSPathGetTemporaryDirectoryForReplaceObject functions). 

    If the kFSReplaceObjectSaveOriginalAsABackup option is specified, the original
    object will be saved in one of two locations: If the temporaryName parameter
    is provided, the original object will be saved with that temporary name in
    the temporary directory. If the temporaryName parameter is not provided and
    the newName parameter is provided, the original object will be saved with
    its original name in the temporary directory.

    The result object will have the data (or directory contents) from the
    replacement object, but will have the original object's creation date and
    backup date. By default, the result object will have extended attributes
    merged from the original object and the replacement object, using the extended
    attributes of the replacement object if the original object has extended
    attributes with the same name. If the kFSReplaceObjectReplaceMetadata option
    flag is passed, then the extended attributes of the original object will be
    completely overwritten by the extended attributes of the replacement object.
    
    The kFSReplaceObjectReplaceMetadata also controls how the label, type, creator,
    hidden extension bit, strong binding, custom icon and custom badge are handled.
    For the custom icon, custom badge, label (where a value of 0 is considered not
    present), and strong binding the replacement object's attributes will be
    used if present, otherwise the original object's attributes will be retained.  For
    the extension hidden bit, type, and creator the original object's attribute is
    preserved.  Setting the kFSReplaceObjectReplaceMetadata flag will use the replacement
    object's attributes for all cases.  Type and creator are only handled in the 
    file to file case.  Strong bindings are not applicable to plain directories.
    
    The default handling of ACL and mode info depends on the types of objects
    involved. If the original object and replacement object are of the same type
    (both files or both directories) then the default behavior is to use the ACL
    and mode of the original object. Setting the kFSReplaceObjectReplacePermissionInfo
    flag will use the ACL and mode from the replacementObject.

    If the objects are different types, then the ACL and mode will be based off
    the original object and will translated as follows:

        Mode:
        file r -> dir rx
        file w -> dir wx
        file x -> dir nothing

        dir r -> file r
        dir w -> file w
        dir x -> file nothing

        ACLs:

        ACL_SEARCH will be added to any allow ACE in the file to directory case.
        ACL_EXECUTE will be removed from any ACE in the file to directory case.
        
        ACL_SEARCH and ACL_DELETE_CHILD will be removed from any ACE in the directory to file case.

        File                Directory
        ACL_READ_DATA   <-> ACL_LIST_DIRECTORY
        ACL_WRITE_DATA  <-> ACL_ADD_FILE
        ACL_APPEND_DATA <-> ACL_ADD_SUBDIRECTORY

        ACL_DELETE , ACL_READ_ATTRIBUTES, ACL_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES, ACL_READ_EXTATTRIBUTES,
        ACL_WRITE_EXTATTRIBUTES, ACL_READ_SECURITY, ACL_WRITE_SECURITY and ACL_CHANGE_OWNER
        are the same for both types and will be left alone.
                        
    This translation behavior can be avoided by passing in either
    kFSReplaceObjectPreservePermissionInfo to use the original object ACL and
    mode info unchanged (except where the bits have different meanings for files
    and directories) or kFSReplaceObjectReplacePermissionInfo to use the ACL and
    mode info of the replacement object (except where the bits have different
    meanings for files and directories). Setting both of these flags is an
    error -- the call will fail with a paramErr. The permissions are only set on
    the top-level object -- the permissions inside a directory are unaffected.
    
    FSReplaceObject may not be atomic -- it may issue multiple system calls to
    accurately replace and preserve the metadata of a file system object.
    
    FSReplaceObject may fail if the source or destination files are open or
    the source or destination objects are directories which contain open files.

    Note: the foundRefNum, ref, forkInfo, and fork name outputs are all optional; if you don't want
    a particular output, then set its pointer to NULL.  If forkName is NULL, then forkNameLength
    will be undefined.
    Note: Returning the forkInfo generally does not require a disk access.  Returning the
    ref or forkName may cause disk access for some volume formats.

{
    FSReplaceObject and FSPathReplaceObject

    You can use the FSReplaceObject and FSPathReplaceObject functions to replace
    one object, the original object, with another, the replacement object.
    FSReplaceObject and FSPathReplaceObject are provided to assist in properly
    preserving metadata during safe save operations. These functions allow files
    to replace files, directories to replace directories, directories to replace
    files and files to replace directories (so a package can replace a file, or
    a file can replace a package). Both objects must reside on the same volume.

    If FSReplaceObject or FSPathReplaceObject are successful, the result object
    will exist at the location of the original object. Nothing will exist at the
    location of the replacement object.  By default FSReplaceObject and  FSPathReplaceObject
    will test the object for write access, and fail if write access is not available.
    Write access in this context is ACL_WRITE_DATA for files and ACL_ADD_FILE for directories.
    This check can be bypassed by passing the kFSReplaceObjectDoNotCheckObjectWriteAccess flag.

    FSReplaceObject and FSPathReplaceObject may need to create a temporary object
    when one of the input objects is a directory, or when the
    kFSReplaceObjectSaveOriginalAsABackup option is specified. The temporary object
    is required since the rename system call does not handle non-empty directory
    replacement or file <-> directory replacement. The file replacing file case
    does not use a temporary object (unless the kFSReplaceObjectSaveOriginalAsABackup
    option is specified). If no temporary name is provided and a temporary object
    is required, then the functions will return an error. Providing a temporary
    name will also allow an application to recover the original object should a
    catastrophic failure (such as a power outage) occur during a replacement
    involving a directory. The temporary object will be created with the temporary
    name either in the temporary directory specified by the temporaryDirectory
    parameter, or in the preferred temporary directory (the preferred temporary
    directory can be obtained with the FSGetTemporaryDirectoryForReplaceObject
    or FSPathGetTemporaryDirectoryForReplaceObject functions). 

    If the kFSReplaceObjectSaveOriginalAsABackup option is specified, the original
    object will be saved in one of two locations: If the temporaryName parameter
    is provided, the original object will be saved with that temporary name in
    the temporary directory. If the temporaryName parameter is not provided and
    the newName parameter is provided, the original object will be saved with
    its original name in the temporary directory.

    The result object will have the data (or directory contents) from the
    replacement object, but will have the original object's creation date and
    backup date. By default, the result object will have extended attributes
    merged from the original object and the replacement object, using the extended
    attributes of the replacement object if the original object has extended
    attributes with the same name. If the kFSReplaceObjectReplaceMetadata option
    flag is passed, then the extended attributes of the original object will be
    completely overwritten by the extended attributes of the replacement object.
    
    The kFSReplaceObjectReplaceMetadata also controls how the label, type, creator,
    hidden extension bit, strong binding, custom icon and custom badge are handled.
    For the custom icon, custom badge, label (where a value of 0 is considered not
    present), and strong binding the replacement object's attributes will be
    used if present, otherwise the original object's attributes will be retained.  For
    the extension hidden bit, type, and creator the original object's attribute is
    preserved.  Setting the kFSReplaceObjectReplaceMetadata flag will use the replacement
    object's attributes for all cases.  Type and creator are only handled in the 
    file to file case.  Strong bindings are not applicable to plain directories.
    
    The default handling of ACL and mode info depends on the types of objects
    involved. If the original object and replacement object are of the same type
    (both files or both directories) then the default behavior is to use the ACL
    and mode of the original object. Setting the kFSReplaceObjectReplacePermissionInfo
    flag will use the ACL and mode from the replacementObject.

    If the objects are different types, then the ACL and mode will be based off
    the original object and will translated as follows:

        Mode:
        file r -> dir rx
        file w -> dir wx
        file x -> dir nothing

        dir r -> file r
        dir w -> file w
        dir x -> file nothing

        ACLs:

        ACL_SEARCH will be added to any allow ACE in the file to directory case.
        ACL_EXECUTE will be removed from any ACE in the file to directory case.
        
        ACL_SEARCH and ACL_DELETE_CHILD will be removed from any ACE in the directory to file case.

        File                Directory
        ACL_READ_DATA   <-> ACL_LIST_DIRECTORY
        ACL_WRITE_DATA  <-> ACL_ADD_FILE
        ACL_APPEND_DATA <-> ACL_ADD_SUBDIRECTORY

        ACL_DELETE , ACL_READ_ATTRIBUTES, ACL_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES, ACL_READ_EXTATTRIBUTES,
        ACL_WRITE_EXTATTRIBUTES, ACL_READ_SECURITY, ACL_WRITE_SECURITY and ACL_CHANGE_OWNER
        are the same for both types and will be left alone.
                        
    This translation behavior can be avoided by passing in either
    kFSReplaceObjectPreservePermissionInfo to use the original object ACL and
    mode info unchanged (except where the bits have different meanings for files
    and directories) or kFSReplaceObjectReplacePermissionInfo to use the ACL and
    mode info of the replacement object (except where the bits have different
    meanings for files and directories). Setting both of these flags is an
    error -- the call will fail with a paramErr. The permissions are only set on
    the top-level object -- the permissions inside a directory are unaffected.
    
    FSReplaceObject may not be atomic -- it may issue multiple system calls to
    accurately replace and preserve the metadata of a file system object.
    
    FSReplaceObject may fail if the source or destination files are open or
    the source or destination objects are directories which contain open files.

{
    FSReplaceObject and FSPathReplaceObject

    You can use the FSReplaceObject and FSPathReplaceObject functions to replace
    one object, the original object, with another, the replacement object.
    FSReplaceObject and FSPathReplaceObject are provided to assist in properly
    preserving metadata during safe save operations. These functions allow files
    to replace files, directories to replace directories, directories to replace
    files and files to replace directories (so a package can replace a file, or
    a file can replace a package). Both objects must reside on the same volume.

    If FSReplaceObject or FSPathReplaceObject are successful, the result object
    will exist at the location of the original object. Nothing will exist at the
    location of the replacement object.  By default FSReplaceObject and  FSPathReplaceObject
    will test the object for write access, and fail if write access is not available.
    Write access in this context is ACL_WRITE_DATA for files and ACL_ADD_FILE for directories.
    This check can be bypassed by passing the kFSReplaceObjectDoNotCheckObjectWriteAccess flag.

    FSReplaceObject and FSPathReplaceObject may need to create a temporary object
    when one of the input objects is a directory, or when the
    kFSReplaceObjectSaveOriginalAsABackup option is specified. The temporary object
    is required since the rename system call does not handle non-empty directory
    replacement or file <-> directory replacement. The file replacing file case
    does not use a temporary object (unless the kFSReplaceObjectSaveOriginalAsABackup
    option is specified). If no temporary name is provided and a temporary object
    is required, then the functions will return an error. Providing a temporary
    name will also allow an application to recover the original object should a
    catastrophic failure (such as a power outage) occur during a replacement
    involving a directory. The temporary object will be created with the temporary
    name either in the temporary directory specified by the temporaryDirectory
    parameter, or in the preferred temporary directory (the preferred temporary
    directory can be obtained with the FSGetTemporaryDirectoryForReplaceObject
    or FSPathGetTemporaryDirectoryForReplaceObject functions). 

    If the kFSReplaceObjectSaveOriginalAsABackup option is specified, the original
    object will be saved in one of two locations: If the temporaryName parameter
    is provided, the original object will be saved with that temporary name in
    the temporary directory. If the temporaryName parameter is not provided and
    the newName parameter is provided, the original object will be saved with
    its original name in the temporary directory.

    The result object will have the data (or directory contents) from the
    replacement object, but will have the original object's creation date and
    backup date. By default, the result object will have extended attributes
    merged from the original object and the replacement object, using the extended
    attributes of the replacement object if the original object has extended
    attributes with the same name. If the kFSReplaceObjectReplaceMetadata option
    flag is passed, then the extended attributes of the original object will be
    completely overwritten by the extended attributes of the replacement object.
    
    The kFSReplaceObjectReplaceMetadata also controls how the label, type, creator,
    hidden extension bit, strong binding, custom icon and custom badge are handled.
    For the custom icon, custom badge, label (where a value of 0 is considered not
    present), and strong binding the replacement object's attributes will be
    used if present, otherwise the original object's attributes will be retained.  For
    the extension hidden bit, type, and creator the original object's attribute is
    preserved.  Setting the kFSReplaceObjectReplaceMetadata flag will use the replacement
    object's attributes for all cases.  Type and creator are only handled in the 
    file to file case.  Strong bindings are not applicable to plain directories.
    
    The default handling of ACL and mode info depends on the types of objects
    involved. If the original object and replacement object are of the same type
    (both files or both directories) then the default behavior is to use the ACL
    and mode of the original object. Setting the kFSReplaceObjectReplacePermissionInfo
    flag will use the ACL and mode from the replacementObject.

    If the objects are different types, then the ACL and mode will be based off
    the original object and will translated as follows:

        Mode:
        file r -> dir rx
        file w -> dir wx
        file x -> dir nothing

        dir r -> file r
        dir w -> file w
        dir x -> file nothing

        ACLs:

        ACL_SEARCH will be added to any allow ACE in the file to directory case.
        ACL_EXECUTE will be removed from any ACE in the file to directory case.
        
        ACL_SEARCH and ACL_DELETE_CHILD will be removed from any ACE in the directory to file case.

        File                Directory
        ACL_READ_DATA   <-> ACL_LIST_DIRECTORY
        ACL_WRITE_DATA  <-> ACL_ADD_FILE
        ACL_APPEND_DATA <-> ACL_ADD_SUBDIRECTORY

        ACL_DELETE , ACL_READ_ATTRIBUTES, ACL_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES, ACL_READ_EXTATTRIBUTES,
        ACL_WRITE_EXTATTRIBUTES, ACL_READ_SECURITY, ACL_WRITE_SECURITY and ACL_CHANGE_OWNER
        are the same for both types and will be left alone.
                        
    This translation behavior can be avoided by passing in either
    kFSReplaceObjectPreservePermissionInfo to use the original object ACL and
    mode info unchanged (except where the bits have different meanings for files
    and directories) or kFSReplaceObjectReplacePermissionInfo to use the ACL and
    mode info of the replacement object (except where the bits have different
    meanings for files and directories). Setting both of these flags is an
    error -- the call will fail with a paramErr. The permissions are only set on
    the top-level object -- the permissions inside a directory are unaffected.
    
    FSReplaceObject may not be atomic -- it may issue multiple system calls to
    accurately replace and preserve the metadata of a file system object.
    
    FSReplaceObject may fail if the source or destination files are open or
    the source or destination objects are directories which contain open files.

 *  FNNotify()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Broadcasts notification of changes to the specified directory.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    FNNotify is used to notify system clients (such as the Finder) of
 *    modifications to the contents of a directory, specifically
 *    addition or removal of files or folders from the directory. The
 *    Finder and other system clients will refresh their views of the
 *    specified directory when they receive the change notification.
 *    FNNotify is not meant to notify the Finder of changes to a
 *    specific file (for example, changes to a file's type or creator);
 *    for that purpose, use a kAESync AppleEvent sent to the Finder.

 *    Broadcasts notification of changes to the specified directory.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    FNNotify is used to notify system clients (such as the Finder) of
 *    modifications to the contents of a directory, specifically
 *    addition or removal of files or folders from the directory. The
 *    Finder and other system clients will refresh their views of the
 *    specified directory when they receive the change notification.
 *    FNNotify is not meant to notify the Finder of changes to a
 *    specific file (for example, changes to a file's type or creator);
 *    for that purpose, use a kAESync AppleEvent sent to the Finder.

{
    FSReplaceObject and FSPathReplaceObject

    You can use the FSReplaceObject and FSPathReplaceObject functions to replace
    one object, the original object, with another, the replacement object.
    FSReplaceObject and FSPathReplaceObject are provided to assist in properly
    preserving metadata during safe save operations. These functions allow files
    to replace files, directories to replace directories, directories to replace
    files and files to replace directories (so a package can replace a file, or
    a file can replace a package). Both objects must reside on the same volume.

    If FSReplaceObject or FSPathReplaceObject are successful, the result object
    will exist at the location of the original object. Nothing will exist at the
    location of the replacement object.  By default FSReplaceObject and  FSPathReplaceObject
    will test the object for write access, and fail if write access is not available.
    Write access in this context is ACL_WRITE_DATA for files and ACL_ADD_FILE for directories.
    This check can be bypassed by passing the kFSReplaceObjectDoNotCheckObjectWriteAccess flag.

    FSReplaceObject and FSPathReplaceObject may need to create a temporary object
    when one of the input objects is a directory, or when the
    kFSReplaceObjectSaveOriginalAsABackup option is specified. The temporary object
    is required since the rename system call does not handle non-empty directory
    replacement or file <-> directory replacement. The file replacing file case
    does not use a temporary object (unless the kFSReplaceObjectSaveOriginalAsABackup
    option is specified). If no temporary name is provided and a temporary object
    is required, then the functions will return an error. Providing a temporary
    name will also allow an application to recover the original object should a
    catastrophic failure (such as a power outage) occur during a replacement
    involving a directory. The temporary object will be created with the temporary
    name either in the temporary directory specified by the temporaryDirectory
    parameter, or in the preferred temporary directory (the preferred temporary
    directory can be obtained with the FSGetTemporaryDirectoryForReplaceObject
    or FSPathGetTemporaryDirectoryForReplaceObject functions). 

    If the kFSReplaceObjectSaveOriginalAsABackup option is specified, the original
    object will be saved in one of two locations: If the temporaryName parameter
    is provided, the original object will be saved with that temporary name in
    the temporary directory. If the temporaryName parameter is not provided and
    the newName parameter is provided, the original object will be saved with
    its original name in the temporary directory.

    The result object will have the data (or directory contents) from the
    replacement object, but will have the original object's creation date and
    backup date. By default, the result object will have extended attributes
    merged from the original object and the replacement object, using the extended
    attributes of the replacement object if the original object has extended
    attributes with the same name. If the kFSReplaceObjectReplaceMetadata option
    flag is passed, then the extended attributes of the original object will be
    completely overwritten by the extended attributes of the replacement object.
    
    The kFSReplaceObjectReplaceMetadata also controls how the label, type, creator,
    hidden extension bit, strong binding, custom icon and custom badge are handled.
    For the custom icon, custom badge, label (where a value of 0 is considered not
    present), and strong binding the replacement object's attributes will be
    used if present, otherwise the original object's attributes will be retained.  For
    the extension hidden bit, type, and creator the original object's attribute is
    preserved.  Setting the kFSReplaceObjectReplaceMetadata flag will use the replacement
    object's attributes for all cases.  Type and creator are only handled in the 
    file to file case.  Strong bindings are not applicable to plain directories.
    
    The default handling of ACL and mode info depends on the types of objects
    involved. If the original object and replacement object are of the same type
    (both files or both directories) then the default behavior is to use the ACL
    and mode of the original object. Setting the kFSReplaceObjectReplacePermissionInfo
    flag will use the ACL and mode from the replacementObject.

    If the objects are different types, then the ACL and mode will be based off
    the original object and will translated as follows:

        Mode:
        file r -> dir rx
        file w -> dir wx
        file x -> dir nothing

        dir r -> file r
        dir w -> file w
        dir x -> file nothing

        ACLs:

        ACL_SEARCH will be added to any allow ACE in the file to directory case.
        ACL_EXECUTE will be removed from any ACE in the file to directory case.
        
        ACL_SEARCH and ACL_DELETE_CHILD will be removed from any ACE in the directory to file case.

        File                Directory
        ACL_READ_DATA   <-> ACL_LIST_DIRECTORY
        ACL_WRITE_DATA  <-> ACL_ADD_FILE
        ACL_APPEND_DATA <-> ACL_ADD_SUBDIRECTORY

        ACL_DELETE , ACL_READ_ATTRIBUTES, ACL_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES, ACL_READ_EXTATTRIBUTES,
        ACL_WRITE_EXTATTRIBUTES, ACL_READ_SECURITY, ACL_WRITE_SECURITY and ACL_CHANGE_OWNER
        are the same for both types and will be left alone.
                        
    This translation behavior can be avoided by passing in either
    kFSReplaceObjectPreservePermissionInfo to use the original object ACL and
    mode info unchanged (except where the bits have different meanings for files
    and directories) or kFSReplaceObjectReplacePermissionInfo to use the ACL and
    mode info of the replacement object (except where the bits have different
    meanings for files and directories). Setting both of these flags is an
    error -- the call will fail with a paramErr. The permissions are only set on
    the top-level object -- the permissions inside a directory are unaffected.
    
    FSReplaceObject may not be atomic -- it may issue multiple system calls to
    accurately replace and preserve the metadata of a file system object.
    
    FSReplaceObject may fail if the source or destination files are open or
    the source or destination objects are directories which contain open files.

 *    specified by source to the trash.  If the volume the source
 *    object resides on does not support a trash folder then this call
 *    will return an error (this is the same circumstance that triggers
 *    the delete immediately behavior in the Finder). Status callbacks
 *    will occur on one of the runloop/mode combinations that the
 *    operation was scheduled on (and is running).  Note that the
 *    object may be renamed when placed in the trash.  Upon successful
 *    completion of the operation the last currentItem (from either the
 *    last status callback or retrieved by
 *    FSPathFileOperationCopyStatus) will be object in the trash.

    FSReplaceObject and FSPathReplaceObject

    You can use the FSReplaceObject and FSPathReplaceObject functions to replace
    one object, the original object, with another, the replacement object.
    FSReplaceObject and FSPathReplaceObject are provided to assist in properly
    preserving metadata during safe save operations. These functions allow files
    to replace files, directories to replace directories, directories to replace
    files and files to replace directories (so a package can replace a file, or
    a file can replace a package). Both objects must reside on the same volume.

    If FSReplaceObject or FSPathReplaceObject are successful, the result object
    will exist at the location of the original object. Nothing will exist at the
    location of the replacement object.  By default FSReplaceObject and  FSPathReplaceObject
    will test the object for write access, and fail if write access is not available.
    Write access in this context is ACL_WRITE_DATA for files and ACL_ADD_FILE for directories.
    This check can be bypassed by passing the kFSReplaceObjectDoNotCheckObjectWriteAccess flag.

    FSReplaceObject and FSPathReplaceObject may need to create a temporary object
    when one of the input objects is a directory, or when the
    kFSReplaceObjectSaveOriginalAsABackup option is specified. The temporary object
    is required since the rename system call does not handle non-empty directory
    replacement or file <-> directory replacement. The file replacing file case
    does not use a temporary object (unless the kFSReplaceObjectSaveOriginalAsABackup
    option is specified). If no temporary name is provided and a temporary object
    is required, then the functions will return an error. Providing a temporary
    name will also allow an application to recover the original object should a
    catastrophic failure (such as a power outage) occur during a replacement
    involving a directory. The temporary object will be created with the temporary
    name either in the temporary directory specified by the temporaryDirectory
    parameter, or in the preferred temporary directory (the preferred temporary
    directory can be obtained with the FSGetTemporaryDirectoryForReplaceObject
    or FSPathGetTemporaryDirectoryForReplaceObject functions). 

    If the kFSReplaceObjectSaveOriginalAsABackup option is specified, the original
    object will be saved in one of two locations: If the temporaryName parameter
    is provided, the original object will be saved with that temporary name in
    the temporary directory. If the temporaryName parameter is not provided and
    the newName parameter is provided, the original object will be saved with
    its original name in the temporary directory.

    The result object will have the data (or directory contents) from the
    replacement object, but will have the original object's creation date and
    backup date. By default, the result object will have extended attributes
    merged from the original object and the replacement object, using the extended
    attributes of the replacement object if the original object has extended
    attributes with the same name. If the kFSReplaceObjectReplaceMetadata option
    flag is passed, then the extended attributes of the original object will be
    completely overwritten by the extended attributes of the replacement object.
    
    The kFSReplaceObjectReplaceMetadata also controls how the label, type, creator,
    hidden extension bit, strong binding, custom icon and custom badge are handled.
    For the custom icon, custom badge, label (where a value of 0 is considered not
    present), and strong binding the replacement object's attributes will be
    used if present, otherwise the original object's attributes will be retained.  For
    the extension hidden bit, type, and creator the original object's attribute is
    preserved.  Setting the kFSReplaceObjectReplaceMetadata flag will use the replacement
    object's attributes for all cases.  Type and creator are only handled in the 
    file to file case.  Strong bindings are not applicable to plain directories.
    
    The default handling of ACL and mode info depends on the types of objects
    involved. If the original object and replacement object are of the same type
    (both files or both directories) then the default behavior is to use the ACL
    and mode of the original object. Setting the kFSReplaceObjectReplacePermissionInfo
    flag will use the ACL and mode from the replacementObject.

    If the objects are different types, then the ACL and mode will be based off
    the original object and will translated as follows:

        Mode:
        file r -> dir rx
        file w -> dir wx
        file x -> dir nothing

        dir r -> file r
        dir w -> file w
        dir x -> file nothing

        ACLs:

        ACL_SEARCH will be added to any allow ACE in the file to directory case.
        ACL_EXECUTE will be removed from any ACE in the file to directory case.
        
        ACL_SEARCH and ACL_DELETE_CHILD will be removed from any ACE in the directory to file case.

        File                Directory
        ACL_READ_DATA   <-> ACL_LIST_DIRECTORY
        ACL_WRITE_DATA  <-> ACL_ADD_FILE
        ACL_APPEND_DATA <-> ACL_ADD_SUBDIRECTORY

        ACL_DELETE , ACL_READ_ATTRIBUTES, ACL_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES, ACL_READ_EXTATTRIBUTES,
        ACL_WRITE_EXTATTRIBUTES, ACL_READ_SECURITY, ACL_WRITE_SECURITY and ACL_CHANGE_OWNER
        are the same for both types and will be left alone.
                        
    This translation behavior can be avoided by passing in either
    kFSReplaceObjectPreservePermissionInfo to use the original object ACL and
    mode info unchanged (except where the bits have different meanings for files
    and directories) or kFSReplaceObjectReplacePermissionInfo to use the ACL and
    mode info of the replacement object (except where the bits have different
    meanings for files and directories). Setting both of these flags is an
    error -- the call will fail with a paramErr. The permissions are only set on
    the top-level object -- the permissions inside a directory are unaffected.
    
    FSReplaceObject may not be atomic -- it may issue multiple system calls to
    accurately replace and preserve the metadata of a file system object.
    
    FSReplaceObject may fail if the source or destination files are open or
    the source or destination objects are directories which contain open files.

    FSReplaceObject and FSPathReplaceObject

    You can use the FSReplaceObject and FSPathReplaceObject functions to replace
    one object, the original object, with another, the replacement object.
    FSReplaceObject and FSPathReplaceObject are provided to assist in properly
    preserving metadata during safe save operations. These functions allow files
    to replace files, directories to replace directories, directories to replace
    files and files to replace directories (so a package can replace a file, or
    a file can replace a package). Both objects must reside on the same volume.

    If FSReplaceObject or FSPathReplaceObject are successful, the result object
    will exist at the location of the original object. Nothing will exist at the
    location of the replacement object.  By default FSReplaceObject and  FSPathReplaceObject
    will test the object for write access, and fail if write access is not available.
    Write access in this context is ACL_WRITE_DATA for files and ACL_ADD_FILE for directories.
    This check can be bypassed by passing the kFSReplaceObjectDoNotCheckObjectWriteAccess flag.

    FSReplaceObject and FSPathReplaceObject may need to create a temporary object
    when one of the input objects is a directory, or when the
    kFSReplaceObjectSaveOriginalAsABackup option is specified. The temporary object
    is required since the rename system call does not handle non-empty directory
    replacement or file <-> directory replacement. The file replacing file case
    does not use a temporary object (unless the kFSReplaceObjectSaveOriginalAsABackup
    option is specified). If no temporary name is provided and a temporary object
    is required, then the functions will return an error. Providing a temporary
    name will also allow an application to recover the original object should a
    catastrophic failure (such as a power outage) occur during a replacement
    involving a directory. The temporary object will be created with the temporary
    name either in the temporary directory specified by the temporaryDirectory
    parameter, or in the preferred temporary directory (the preferred temporary
    directory can be obtained with the FSGetTemporaryDirectoryForReplaceObject
    or FSPathGetTemporaryDirectoryForReplaceObject functions). 

    If the kFSReplaceObjectSaveOriginalAsABackup option is specified, the original
    object will be saved in one of two locations: If the temporaryName parameter
    is provided, the original object will be saved with that temporary name in
    the temporary directory. If the temporaryName parameter is not provided and
    the newName parameter is provided, the original object will be saved with
    its original name in the temporary directory.

    The result object will have the data (or directory contents) from the
    replacement object, but will have the original object's creation date and
    backup date. By default, the result object will have extended attributes
    merged from the original object and the replacement object, using the extended
    attributes of the replacement object if the original object has extended
    attributes with the same name. If the kFSReplaceObjectReplaceMetadata option
    flag is passed, then the extended attributes of the original object will be
    completely overwritten by the extended attributes of the replacement object.
    
    The kFSReplaceObjectReplaceMetadata also controls how the label, type, creator,
    hidden extension bit, strong binding, custom icon and custom badge are handled.
    For the custom icon, custom badge, label (where a value of 0 is considered not
    present), and strong binding the replacement object's attributes will be
    used if present, otherwise the original object's attributes will be retained.  For
    the extension hidden bit, type, and creator the original object's attribute is
    preserved.  Setting the kFSReplaceObjectReplaceMetadata flag will use the replacement
    object's attributes for all cases.  Type and creator are only handled in the 
    file to file case.  Strong bindings are not applicable to plain directories.
    
    The default handling of ACL and mode info depends on the types of objects
    involved. If the original object and replacement object are of the same type
    (both files or both directories) then the default behavior is to use the ACL
    and mode of the original object. Setting the kFSReplaceObjectReplacePermissionInfo
    flag will use the ACL and mode from the replacementObject.

    If the objects are different types, then the ACL and mode will be based off
    the original object and will translated as follows:

        Mode:
        file r -> dir rx
        file w -> dir wx
        file x -> dir nothing

        dir r -> file r
        dir w -> file w
        dir x -> file nothing

        ACLs:

        ACL_SEARCH will be added to any allow ACE in the file to directory case.
        ACL_EXECUTE will be removed from any ACE in the file to directory case.
        
        ACL_SEARCH and ACL_DELETE_CHILD will be removed from any ACE in the directory to file case.

        File                Directory
        ACL_READ_DATA   <-> ACL_LIST_DIRECTORY
        ACL_WRITE_DATA  <-> ACL_ADD_FILE
        ACL_APPEND_DATA <-> ACL_ADD_SUBDIRECTORY

        ACL_DELETE , ACL_READ_ATTRIBUTES, ACL_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES, ACL_READ_EXTATTRIBUTES,
        ACL_WRITE_EXTATTRIBUTES, ACL_READ_SECURITY, ACL_WRITE_SECURITY and ACL_CHANGE_OWNER
        are the same for both types and will be left alone.
                        
    This translation behavior can be avoided by passing in either
    kFSReplaceObjectPreservePermissionInfo to use the original object ACL and
    mode info unchanged (except where the bits have different meanings for files
    and directories) or kFSReplaceObjectReplacePermissionInfo to use the ACL and
    mode info of the replacement object (except where the bits have different
    meanings for files and directories). Setting both of these flags is an
    error -- the call will fail with a paramErr. The permissions are only set on
    the top-level object -- the permissions inside a directory are unaffected.
    
    FSReplaceObject may not be atomic -- it may issue multiple system calls to
    accurately replace and preserve the metadata of a file system object.
    
    FSReplaceObject may fail if the source or destination files are open or
    the source or destination objects are directories which contain open files.

 *    specific file (for example, changes to a file's type or creator);
 *    for that purpose, use a kAESync AppleEvent sent to the Finder.

 some workarounds are:

 1.  Use CFBundle loading and CFBundleGetDataPointerForName to obtain the correct data.

 2.  For composting windows, the correct data can be obtained with code similar to:

    ignoreResult := GetRootControl( theWind, theContentRoot );
    ignoreResult := GetControlID( theContentRoot, theContentControlID );

    The correct data for kHIViewWindowContentID is in theContentControlID.

 *  Mac OS X threading:

 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    inView:
 *      The view whose compositing state you wish to determine.

<<<<<<< HEAD
 *    Returns the child of the given view hit by the point passed in.
 *    This is more primitive than using HIViewGetViewForMouseEvent, and
 *    should be used only in non-event-handling cases.
=======
 *    Marks a portion of a view as needing to be redrawn, or valid. If
 *    the view is not visible, or is obscured completely by other

 *    
 *    Note that this API does not affect the state of subviews of this

 *    HIViewSetSubviewsNeedDisplayInShape on Mac OS X 10.5 and later,

 *  
 *  Summary:

=======
 *  HIViewSetSubviewsNeedDisplayInShape()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Validates or invalidates a portion of a view and all of its
 *    subviews.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Marks a portion of a view as needing to be redrawn, or valid, and
 *    then does the same for each subview of the view. If the view or a
 *    subview is not visible, or is obscured completely by other views,
 *    no action is taken for that view. The shape passed is effectively
 *    intersected with each view's visible region. The shape should be
 *    in view-relative coordinates. 
 *    
 *    Note! It is very rare that an application truly needs to
 *    invalidate a view and all of its subviews. Normally, when a view
 *    is invalidated, its subviews will be automatically redrawn by the
 *    HIView Manager after the parent view is redrawn, so it is not
 *    necessary to explicitly invalidate the subviews. (The only
 *    exception occurs when the parent view uses
 *    kHIViewFeatureDoesNotDraw; in that case, invalidating the parent
 *    view does nothing, and subviews are not invalidated or redrawn.)
 *    In most cases, if you think you need to use this API, you should
 *    probably consider whether all of the subviews need to redraw, or
 *    just some of them, and explicitly invalidate only those subviews
 *    that need to redraw. That will give you better performance than
 *    invalidating and redrawing every subview.

 *  Summary:
 *    Validates or invalidates a portion of a view and all of its

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Marks a portion of a view as needing to be redrawn, or valid, and
 *    then does the same for each subview of the view. If the view or a
 *    subview is not visible, or is obscured completely by other views,
 *    no action is taken for that view. The shape passed is effectively
 *    intersected with each view's visible region. The shape should be
 *    in view-relative coordinates. 
 *    
 *    Note! It is very rare that an application truly needs to
 *    invalidate a view and all of its subviews. Normally, when a view
 *    is invalidated, its subviews will be automatically redrawn by the
 *    HIView Manager after the parent view is redrawn, so it is not
 *    necessary to explicitly invalidate the subviews. (The only
 *    exception occurs when the parent view uses
 *    kHIViewFeatureDoesNotDraw; in that case, invalidating the parent
 *    view does nothing, and subviews are not invalidated or redrawn.)
 *    In most cases, if you think you need to use this API, you should
 *    probably consider whether all of the subviews need to redraw, or
 *    just some of them, and explicitly invalidate only those subviews
 *    that need to redraw. That will give you better performance than
 *    invalidating and redrawing every subview.

 *  Discussion:

 *    as it does cause a fully composited draw for the area of the
 *    view; that is, all other views that intersect the area of the
 *    specified view will also be drawn. Calling this for several views
 *    at a particular level of a hierarchy can be costly. We highly
 *    recommend that you only pass the root view of a window to this
 *    API. The behavior of this API when passed a non-root view was
 *    poorly defined in Mac OS X 10.3 and has changed in Mac OS X 10.4.
 *    In 10.3, calling this API on a non-root view would entirely
 *    validate all of the views in the window that intersect the
 *    specified view, including portions that did not intersect the
 *    specified view and so were not actually drawn. In 10.4, calling

 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Validates or invalidates a portion of a view and all of its
 *    subviews.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Marks a portion of a view as needing to be redrawn, or valid, and
 *    then does the same for each subview of the view. If the view or a
 *    subview is not visible, or is obscured completely by other views,
 *    no action is taken for that view. The shape passed is effectively
 *    intersected with each view's visible region. The shape should be
 *    in view-relative coordinates. 
 *    
 *    Note! It is very rare that an application truly needs to
 *    invalidate a view and all of its subviews. Normally, when a view
 *    is invalidated, its subviews will be automatically redrawn by the
 *    HIView Manager after the parent view is redrawn, so it is not
 *    necessary to explicitly invalidate the subviews. (The only
 *    exception occurs when the parent view uses
 *    kHIViewFeatureDoesNotDraw; in that case, invalidating the parent
 *    view does nothing, and subviews are not invalidated or redrawn.)
 *    In most cases, if you think you need to use this API, you should
 *    probably consider whether all of the subviews need to redraw, or
 *    just some of them, and explicitly invalidate only those subviews
 *    that need to redraw. That will give you better performance than
 *    invalidating and redrawing every subview.

 *  Summary:

 *  
 *  Discussion:
<<<<<<< HEAD
 *    There are several factors that control whether a view should show
 *    focus indicators, including: 
 *    
 *    - does the view have a focused part? 
 *    - is the view active? 
 *    - is the view enabled? 
 *    - is the view contained in a window that shows focus indicators?
 *    
 *    
 *    This API encapsulates checking for all of these factors.
 *    Typically, a view will call this API in its kEventControlDraw
 *    handler to determine whether it should draw focus indicators in
 *    addition to its normal drawing.
=======
 *    This API sets the origin of the view. This effectively also moves
 *    all subviews of a view as well. This call will NOT invalidate the
 *    view. This is because you might want to move the contents with
 *    HIViewScrollRect instead of redrawing the complete content.

 *  Discussion:
 *    Allows you to change a view's features on the fly. Typically,
 *    this is up to the view itself to control. For example, it might
 *    decide that under some situations it is opaque and in others it
 *    is transparent. In general entities outside of the view itself
 *    should not call this function. The only exception might be UI
 *    building tools, where it would want to make sure a view always
 *    responds to clicks, for example, so it could override mouse
 *    tracking to drag items around. 
 *    
 *    When implementing a custom HIView, it is common to use
 *    HIViewChangeFeatures in the view's kEventHIObjectInitialize
 *    function to set up the view's initial feature bits. If your view
 *    needs to run on Mac OS X 10.2, however, where
 *    HIViewChangeFeatures is not available, you can set the view's
 *    initial feature bits by handling kEventControlInitialize and
 *    returning the appropriate feature flags in the
 *    kEventParamControlFeatures parameter. Note that in this case, you
 *    can only return feature flag constants starting with "kControl"
 *    from the Control Feature Bits enumeration in Controls.h; you
 *    cannot return kHIViewFeature constants.

 *    views: HIComboBox, HISearchField, HITextView and EditUnicodeText.
 *    This event is not sent for the classic non-Unicode EditText
 *    control. 
 *    
 *    Note that this event is sent after inline editing operations,
 *    such as pressing a dead key, or using a input method that creates
 *    an inline editing hole. Most clients of this event should ignore
 *    the event during inline editing, and only respond to changes to
 *    the text after inline editing completes. A client can check for
 *    the presence of the kEventParamUnconfirmedRange parameter to
 *    determine whether inline editing is currently active; if this
 *    parameter is present, the client may wish to ignore the event.
 *    
 *    
 *    This event is not sent after programmatic modification of the
 *    text field contents using SetControlData. 
 *    
 *    This event is sent only to the control containing the text field;
 *    it will not propagate. It is sent to all handlers registered for

 *  Summary:
 *    Creates a segmented view. This is the type of view you would use
 *    to implement the icon/column/list view switcher as seen in the
 *    Finder. After creating a segmented view, you need to set the
 *    number of segments via HISegmentedViewSetSegmentCount. Each
 *    segment can be configured independently with via the other
 *    HISegmentedView APIs. Changing the number of segments and
 *    configuring each segment will change the appearance of the
 *    segmented view. After you configure the view, you may want to
 *    call GetBestControlRect on the view and resize it so the content
 *    will fit optimally. The value of the whole segmented view
 *    corresponds to the index of the currently selected segment with
 *    the radio behavior. If you set the value of the whole segmented
 *    view to n via SetControl32BitValue, every radio-behavior segment
 *    will have its value set to zero except for the segment at index
 *    n; if segment n also has the radio behavior, it will have its
 *    value set to one. When a radio-behavior segment is clicked, the
 *    value of the whole segmented view will be set to the segment's
 *    index. The segmented view works in both compositing and
 *    non-compositing modes.

 *    is transparent. In general entities outside of the view itself
 *    should not call this function. The only exception might be UI
 *    building tools, where it would want to make sure a view always
 *    responds to clicks, for example, so it could override mouse
 *    tracking to drag items around. 
 *    
 *    When implementing a custom HIView, it is common to use
 *    HIViewChangeFeatures in the view's kEventHIObjectInitialize
 *    function to set up the view's initial feature bits. If your view
 *    needs to run on Mac OS X 10.2, however, where
 *    HIViewChangeFeatures is not available, you can set the view's
 *    initial feature bits by handling kEventControlInitialize and
 *    returning the appropriate feature flags in the
 *    kEventParamControlFeatures parameter. Note that in this case, you
 *    can only return feature flag constants starting with "kControl"
 *    from the Control Feature Bits enumeration in Controls.h; you
 *    cannot return kHIViewFeature constants.

 *  HIViewChangeFeatures()
 *  
=======
>>>>>>> graemeg/cpstrnew
 *  Discussion:
 *    Allows you to change a view's features on the fly. Typically,

 *    decide that under some situations it is opaque and in others it
 *    is transparent. In general entities outside of the view itself
 *    should not call this function. The only exception might be UI
 *    building tools, where it would want to make sure a view always
 *    responds to clicks, for example, so it could override mouse
 *    tracking to drag items around. 
 *    
 *    When implementing a custom HIView, it is common to use
 *    HIViewChangeFeatures in the view's kEventHIObjectInitialize
 *    function to set up the view's initial feature bits. If your view
 *    needs to run on Mac OS X 10.2, however, where
 *    HIViewChangeFeatures is not available, you can set the view's
 *    initial feature bits by handling kEventControlInitialize and
 *    returning the appropriate feature flags in the
 *    kEventParamControlFeatures parameter. Note that in this case, you
 *    can only return feature flag constants starting with "kControl"
 *    from the Control Feature Bits enumeration in Controls.h; you
 *    cannot return kHIViewFeature constants.

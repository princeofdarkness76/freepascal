    In order for MachineLocation to be endian-safe, a new member 
    has been added to the 'u' union in the structure. You are 
    encouraged to use the new member instead of the old one.
    
    If your code looked like this:
    
        MachineLocation.u.dlsDelta = isDLS? 0x80: 0x00;
    
    you should change it to this:
    
        MachineLocation.u.dls.Delta = isDLS? 0x80: 0x00;
    
    to be endian safe. The gmtDelta remains the same; the low 24-bits
    are used. Remember that order of assignment DOES matter:
    
    This will overwrite results:
    
        MachineLocation.u.dls.Delta = 0xAA;         // u = 0xAAGGGGGG; G=Garbage
        MachineLocation.u.gmtDelta = 0xBBBBBB;      // u = 0x00BBBBBB;
    
    when in fact reversing the assignment would have preserved the values:

        MachineLocation.u.gmtDelta = 0xBBBBBB;      // u = 0x00BBBBBB;  
        MachineLocation.u.dls.Delta = 0xAA;         // u = 0xAABBBBBB;
        
    NOTE:   The information regarding dlsDelta in Inside Mac is INCORRECT.
            It's always 0x80 for daylight-saving time or 0x00 for standard time.

 *    The latitude and longitude are stored as Fract values, giving

 *    equals 90 degrees Ð1.0 equals Ð90 degrees and Ð2.0 equals Ð180
 *    degrees.
 *    To convert these values to a degrees format, you need to convert
 *    the Fract values first to the Fixed data type, then to the
 *    LongInt data type. Use the Mathematical and Logical Utilities
 *    functions Fract2Fix and Fix2Long to accomplish this task.
 *    The DST value is a signed byte value that specifies the offset
 *    for the hour fieldÑwhether to add one hour, subtract one hour, or
 *    make no change at all.
 *    The GMT value is in seconds east of GMT. For example, San
 *    Francisco is at Ð28,800 seconds (8 hours * 3,600 seconds per
 *    hour) east of GMT. The gmtDelta field is a 3-byte value contained
 *    in a long word, so you must take care to get it properly.
 *    For more information on the Fract data type and the conversion

 *  Discussion:
 *    The TickCount function returns an unsigned 32-bit integer that

 *    started up. You can use this value to compare the number of ticks
 *    that have elapsed since a given event or other action occurred.
 *    For example, you could compare the current value returned by
 *    TickCount with the value of the when field of an event
 *    structure.
 *    The tick count rolls over in approximately 2 years 3 months,
 *    which means you should not use this to time intervals which may
 *    exceed ( or even approach ) this interval.
 *    Do not rely on the tick count being exact; it is usually accurate

 *  Summary:

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The TickCount function returns an unsigned 32-bit integer that
 *    indicates the current number of ticks since the system last

 *    that have elapsed since a given event or other action occurred.
 *    For example, you could compare the current value returned by
 *    TickCount with the value of the when field of an event
 *    structure.
 *    The tick count rolls over in approximately 2 years 3 months,
 *    which means you should not use this to time intervals which may
 *    exceed ( or even approach ) this interval.
 *    Do not rely on the tick count being exact; it is usually accurate

 *  Summary:

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The latitude and longitude are stored as Fract values, giving
 *    accuracy to within one foot. For example, a Fract value of 1.0
 *    equals 90 degrees Ð1.0 equals Ð90 degrees and Ð2.0 equals Ð180
 *    degrees.
 *    To convert these values to a degrees format, you need to convert
 *    the Fract values first to the Fixed data type, then to the
 *    LongInt data type. Use the Mathematical and Logical Utilities
 *    functions Fract2Fix and Fix2Long to accomplish this task.
 *    The DST value is a signed byte value that specifies the offset
 *    for the hour fieldÑwhether to add one hour, subtract one hour, or
 *    make no change at all.
 *    The GMT value is in seconds east of GMT. For example, San
 *    Francisco is at Ð28,800 seconds (8 hours * 3,600 seconds per
 *    hour) east of GMT. The gmtDelta field is a 3-byte value contained
 *    in a long word, so you must take care to get it properly.
 *    For more information on the Fract data type and the conversion
 *    routines Long2Fix, Fix2Fract, Fract2Fix, and Fix2Long, see
 *    Mathematical and Logical Utilities.

 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Obtains the current number of ticks (a tick is approximately 1/60

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The TickCount function returns an unsigned 32-bit integer that
 *    indicates the current number of ticks since the system last
 *    started up. You can use this value to compare the number of ticks
 *    that have elapsed since a given event or other action occurred.
 *    For example, you could compare the current value returned by
 *    TickCount with the value of the when field of an event
 *    structure.
 *    The tick count rolls over in approximately 2 years 3 months,
 *    which means you should not use this to time intervals which may
 *    exceed ( or even approach ) this interval.
 *    Do not rely on the tick count being exact; it is usually accurate

 *  Summary:

 *    The latitude and longitude are stored as Fract values, giving

 *    equals 90 degrees Ð1.0 equals Ð90 degrees and Ð2.0 equals Ð180
 *    degrees.
 *    To convert these values to a degrees format, you need to convert
 *    the Fract values first to the Fixed data type, then to the
 *    LongInt data type. Use the Mathematical and Logical Utilities
 *    functions Fract2Fix and Fix2Long to accomplish this task.
 *    The DST value is a signed byte value that specifies the offset
 *    for the hour fieldÑwhether to add one hour, subtract one hour, or
 *    make no change at all.
 *    The GMT value is in seconds east of GMT. For example, San
 *    Francisco is at Ð28,800 seconds (8 hours * 3,600 seconds per
 *    hour) east of GMT. The gmtDelta field is a 3-byte value contained
 *    in a long word, so you must take care to get it properly.
 *    For more information on the Fract data type and the conversion
 *    routines Long2Fix, Fix2Fract, Fract2Fix, and Fix2Long, see
 *    Mathematical and Logical Utilities.

 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Obtains the current number of ticks (a tick is approximately 1/60
 *    of a second) approximately since the system last started up.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The TickCount function returns an unsigned 32-bit integer that
 *    indicates the current number of ticks since the system last
 *    started up. You can use this value to compare the number of ticks
 *    that have elapsed since a given event or other action occurred.
 *    For example, you could compare the current value returned by
 *    TickCount with the value of the when field of an event
 *    structure.
 *    The tick count rolls over in approximately 2 years 3 months,
 *    which means you should not use this to time intervals which may
 *    exceed ( or even approach ) this interval.
 *    Do not rely on the tick count being exact; it is usually accurate
 *    to within one tick, but this level of accuracy is not guaranteed.

The supported platforms are Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, Windows Mobile and DOS.

Generally you need the latest stable version of the Free Pascal Compiler, which

currently means version 2.6.2.

 - Compiling the library:
Before starting make sure the FPCDIR environment variable is set correctly.
For example: (windows, fpc version 2.6.2, default install dir)

  set FPCDIR=c:\fpc\2.6.2

=======
>>>>>>> graemeg/cpstrnew
=======
>>>>>>> graemeg/cpstrnew
=======
>>>>>>> origin/cpstrnew

>>>>>>> origin/cpstrnew
currently means version 2.4.0. Generally FPC 2.2.4 should also work fine.

 - Compiling the library:

  set FPCDIR=c:\fpc\2.4.0

To compile the library type:

  fpcmake -r
  make

Then you can do:

  make examples

And then try to run the programs in the demos/ and examples/ dirs.

If compiling the library fails, make sure you're using the GNU make and not
some other make! (e.g. GNU make is usually called 'gmake' on *BSD)

'make -v' should report:
  GNU Make version x.xx.x, ... etc. :)

On Windows and DOS this is the 'make' that comes with Free Pascal.
